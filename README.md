# Оно тебе надо (Do You Need It?)

This is a project work from my web development course, focusing on HTML/CSS layout skills. The goal is to create a responsive page based on a Figma layout, practicing semantic HTML, custom fonts, and modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid.

## Features

- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Custom font setup with `@font-face`
- BEM methodology for CSS organization
- Flexbox and Grid for layout
- GitHub Pages deployment

## Setup

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/Ahmed-Yehya84/ono-tebe-nado.git`
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view locally.
